# The PHANTOM Offline MOM

This tool attempts to invalidate deployments which are generated by the PHANTOM Multi-Objective Mapper using real-time analysis.

When a deployment is created, the Offline MOM runs a variety of analysis techniques to determine whether the system will fail to meet its deadlines.

This tool is called from the PHANTOM Multi-Objective Mapper and does not have to be manually interacted with by the developer.
